### ATG APP

The goal with this app is to practise what we have learned over the last couple of months.

To create a MVP front end app built with React. To get data from the atg api and display it and let the user filter the data.

Main focus for this project is to try and make the development time as short as possible. Nothing fancy, it's just supposed to work.
